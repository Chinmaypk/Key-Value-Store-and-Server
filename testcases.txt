INSERTION TESTS

1. collision on same key
	insert <brit, arthur>
	value of brit is arthur
	insert <brit, hope>
	value of brit is hope

2. collision: allowing multiple entries on same index but different keys
	a. confirm indexes are same by printing
	b. insert both pairs
	c. show that both pairs exist in the table

2. non-collision: allowing multiple entries
	a. confirm indexes are different by printing
	b. insert both pairs
	c. show that both pairs exist in the table

3. simple insert
	a. insert a value
	b. show that the value is in the hash table

MAX AND MIN

1. prevents a key-value pair that is too large from being inserted
2. prevents a key that is larger than key_size from being inserted 
3. shows proper behavior of inserting a null character as a key 
4. if probe reaches the end of the hash table when trying to find a place
to insert, makes sure that it starts searching from the top of the hash table - both on inserting a value and on looking up a value it should have this behavior
5. if the hash table is 100% full - have expected behavior and not loop forever trying to find if a value exists or if there is a place to insert a value
